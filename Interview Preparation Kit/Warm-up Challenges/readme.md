Starter questions present in the Interview Preparation Kit collection.

### 1. Sock Merchant 

**Function:** 

Return the total pairs of elements in an Array that share the same value.

**Input Format:**

The first line contains an Integer `n`, the number of socks represented in `ar`.
The second line contains `n` space-seperated Integers describing the colours of `ar[i]` of the socks in the pile.

**Solution Complexity**

*Time Complexity:* O(logn)

*Space Complexity:* O(n)

`Possible improvements to be made using hashtables`

### 2. Counting Valleys

**Function:**

Returns an integer that denotes the number of valleys traversed.

**Input Format:**

The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of steps in the hike.
The second line contains a single string `s`, of `n` characters that describe his path.

**Solution Complexity**

*Time Complexity:* O(n)

*Space Complexity:* O(n)

### 3. Jumping on the Clouds

**Function:**

Returns the minimum number of jumps required.

**Input Format:**

The first line contains an Integer `n`, the total number of clouds.
The second line contains `n` space-seperated Integers describing clouds `c[i]` where `0 <= i < n`

**Solution Complexity**

*Time Complexity:* O(n)

*Space Complexity:* O(n)

### 4. Repeated String

**Function:** 

Return an integer representing the number of occurrences of `a` in the prefix of length `n` in the infinitely repeating string.

**Input Format:**

The first line contains a single String, `s`.
The second line contains an Integer, `n`.

**Solution Complexity**

*Time Complexity:* O(N) where N = size
