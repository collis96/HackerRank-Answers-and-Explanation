### 1. Left Rotation 

**Function:** 

Rotates elements in an array to the left by amount `d`

**Input Format:**

The first line contains two space-separated integers `n` and `d`, the size of `a` and the number of left rotations you must perform.
The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a[i]`.

**Solution Complexity**

*Time Complexity:* O(N)

*Space Complexity:* O(N)

### 2. 2D Array - DS

**Function:**

Returns an integer, the maximum hourglass sum in the array.

**Input Format:**

Each of the `6` lines of inputs `arr[i]` contains `6` space-separated integers 'arr[i][j]'

**Solution Complexity**

*Time Complexity:* O(N<sup>2</sup>)

*Space Complexity:* O(N<sup>2</sup>)

### 3. New Year Chaos

**Function:**

Prints an integer representing the minimum number of bribes necessary, or Too chaotic if the line configuration is not possible.

**Input Format:**

The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
Each of the next `t` pairs of lines are as follows:
- The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of people in the queue
- The second line has `n` space-separated integers describing the final state of the queue

**Solution Complexity**

*Time Complexity:* O(n)

*Space Complexity:* O(1)
